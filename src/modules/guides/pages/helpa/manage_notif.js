          On Helpa’s web application, click your profile icon or photo then a
          dropdown menu will appear. Choose “Settings” and you will be taken to
          a new sidebar menu. Click the “Notifications” on your sidebar menu and
          you will be redirected to the “Notifications” page.

        <p>
          Helpa can set where to receive notifications either via Email, Push,
          or SMS. The notifications that a Helpa can received are categorized
          into two categories:
        </p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <b className="b-helpa">Messages</b> - these are notifications that
            can be received by Helpa that are outside contracts or non-contract
            related such as:
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>A job invitation is received</li>
            <li>An interview is initiated</li>
            <li>An interview invitation is withdrawn</li>
            <li>A job I applied for has been closed</li>
            <li>An offer is rejected</li>
            <li>An offer is accepted</li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            <b className="b-helpa">Contracts</b> - these are notifications that
            can be received by Helpa are contract- related such as:
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>You are hired</li>
            <li>A contract ends</li>
            <li>Feedback received</li>

          A notification email relays an important message to both Helpa and
          Agent. It is important for them to get notified what has been going on
          with their jobs, contracts, and any activities they do in KeyHelpa.
