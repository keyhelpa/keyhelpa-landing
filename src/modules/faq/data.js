                        Earnings will depend on the rate cost set by the Agent for the job; it's either hourly or in fixed term. Freelancer can also set his/her own terms when sending a proposal for the job but have to take note KeyHelpa will charge  an 11% service fee on all earned money
                        for the lifetime of each job.
