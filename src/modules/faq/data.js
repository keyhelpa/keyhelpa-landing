              Earnings will depend on the rate cost set by the Agent for the
              job; it's either hourly or in fixed term. Freelancer can also set
              his/her own terms when sending a proposal for the job but have to
              take note KeyHelpa will charge an 11% service fee on all earned
              money for the lifetime of each job.
