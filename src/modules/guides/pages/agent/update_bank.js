          To update your bank details, read the following instructions below:
        </p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            On Agent’s web application, click your profile icon or photo then a
            dropdown menu will appear. Choose “Settings” and you will be taken
            to a new sidebar menu. Click the “Billing” on your sidebar menu and
            you will be redirected to the “Banking details” page.
          </li>
          <li>
            On your “Banking details” page, you will need to remove your current
            authorized payment method if you want to replace it with a new one.
            To do this, just click the red trash icon on the card containing
            your current bank details.
          </li>
          <p>
            Once you have clicked the red trash icon, it will then be removed
            and you can now input a new payment method, by filling in the
            following field:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Card Number</li>
            <li>Expiry Date (MM/YY)</li>
            <li>CVC (Card Verification Code)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            After completing the details of payment, just click the “Authorize”
            button to save the new payment method. New payment method will
            automatically be added and saved once it’s verified to be existing
            and active.
          </p>
        </ol>

            Payment logic: Your credit card will be deducted for the amount
            equal to a one week payment, until the job contract is completed or
            cancelled.
          </li>
          <li>
            Payments day: On Monday of each week for the duration of the term of
            the contract the freelancer submits a payment request. The payment
            is equal to "weekly payment''. Payer receives a notification email
            of payment due. The payer is not required to take any action unless
            he/she declines the payment by clicking the decline link.
          </li>
          <li>
            Decline payment: Payer is required to provide reasons for the
            cancellation of the contract and for declining payment. - A
            notification is sent to the freelancer for their reply. The payment
            held in Stripe is held in Keyhelpa's disputed account until the
            dispute is settled within the terms and conditions.
