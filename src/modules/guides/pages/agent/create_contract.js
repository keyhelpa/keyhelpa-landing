          Final job offer or contract is very important to both Agent and Helpa
          as it will provide protection and security for both parties. The terms
          and conditions of employment and the capacity in which a Helpa is
          being hired, along with the corresponding job responsibilities must be
          conveyed in the contract. Most of the content of the contract is just
          the same with the job description you posted, but the contract is now
          more specific and will entail the Helpa when to actually start the job
          and other more important agreements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following information are the guidelines when creating a contract
          between Agent and Helpa through KeyHelpa:
        </p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <b className="b-agent">Basic information</b> - this is where you set
            the final job title or name of the position of the Helpa
          </li>
          <li>
            <b className="b-agent">Description</b> - you will describe the final
            job description of Helpa - i.e., brief explanation of the type of
            work that the Helpa will perform. You may also attach files like
            images or documents to support the job description.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b className="b-agent">Tasks & responsibilities</b> - you will list
            the final tasks and responsibilities a Helpa will actually perform
            in this job.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b className="b-agent">Schedule & locations</b> - you will set the
            final designation of Helpa as to when and what time is his/her
            schedules including the instructions and the list of properties the
            Helpa need to visit or market.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b className="b-agent">Budget</b> - set the final deal of payment
            rate ,you , the Agent, and the Helpa have agreed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b className="b-agent">Preview</b> - this is where you can preview
            how this contract will look like in the Helpa’s view or how this
            contract will appear to Helpa.
          </li>
          <p>
            On the Preview page, this is where you can finally send your job
            offer to Helpa by clicking on the “Send Contract” button which can
            be found at the bottom part of the page and it will automatically
            appear at the top of Helpa’s “My contract” page.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            <b className="b-agent">Note</b>: Before sending the final job offer,
            make sure to review and check if all the information or content of
            the contract is all good and correct. If something is missed or
            wrong, you may click the “Back to Edit” button and correct the
            changes before sending your job offer to Helpa.
          </p>
        </ol>
        <p>
          All the contracts that you have sent to Helpas will be found in your
          “My contracts” page which has the following status: active, pending,
          pause, dispute, end, and rejected.
