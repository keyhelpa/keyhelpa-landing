          Go to your “Successful” Interviews section which can be found on your
          “My proposals” page. Click on the “View” action of the candidate you
          want to hire, and you will be redirected to a page where you can view
          the candidate details including the job terms and proposal. On this
          page you can see the “Reject” and “Hire” button.
        </p>
        <p>
          To hire the candidate, you just need to click on the “Hire” button and
          you will be redirected to creating a contract or the final job offer
          and sending the job offer. Click here to know more about creating a
          contract.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you have sent the job offer or contract, it means you have hired
          the candidate for the job but please take note that it needs to be
          accepted by the Helpa to actually start the job or else the Helpa may
          reject it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every time you send a job offer contract to the Helpa, they will
          receive an email notification that they are hired for the job and that
          you have sent them a job offer contract. In return, you will also
          receive an email notification if the Helpa accepts or rejects the job
          offer.

          Are you done with interviewing a Helpa? Have they met your
          expectations? Are you thinking of letting Helpa do the work on your
          project? If your answer to these questions is yes, then you have to
          hire Helpa now!
