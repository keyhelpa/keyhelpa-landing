            clicking on the “View job” button on the card of the job that
            catches your interest and you will be redirected to the “Job
            details” page of the job post you selected.{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            On the “Job details” page, read the full details of the job and if
            you think that you are fit for the job then click on the “Submit
            proposal” button on the upper right corner of the page and then a
            “Submit proposal” modal will pop up.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the “Submit proposal'' modal, you will need to provide your
            proposed hourly rate and a message which is in less than 150 words
            to tell the hiring agent why you’re the perfect fit for the job.
            Before you submit the proposal, please read to understand and
            acknowledge the following:
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You understand and agree to KeyHelpa's Terms of Conditions,
              including the Privacy Policy.
            </li>
            <li>
              You understand that you will be charged by KeyHelpa Pty Ltd an 11%
              service fee on all earned money for the lifetime of this job.
            </li>
            <li>
              You acknowledge that the work you, Helpa, or any entity you
              control, undertake is done so as a Personal Services Business.
              More specifically, no more than 80% of the annual revenue derives
              from less than 20% of the clients/customers for whom the work is
              performed. To the extent you have any doubt about this position
              you have confirmed it via appropriate, independent, advice.
            </li>
            <p>
              If you have read, understood and acknowledged the foregoing, click
              the “Submit proposal” button to successfully send your proposal to
              the Agent.{" "}
            </p>
          </ul>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, there are opportunities when you don’t have to hunt for a
          freelance job because the Agent will hunt you by inviting you to send
          a job proposal via job invitation. You will receive a job invitation
          via email notification which will eventually lead you to view the job
          invitation details or you may check on your “My proposals” page under{" "}
          <b className="b-helpa">Pending</b> Invite Section, just click the
          “View” on the action column to view the job invitation details page.
          On the “Job details'' page, read the full details of the job and if
          you think that you are fit for the job and want to accept job
          invitation, then click on the “Accept Invite” button on the upper
          right corner of the page and then a “Submit proposal” modal will pop
          up. Then, follow step 4 from the instructions above.
        </p>
        <p>
          All submitted job proposals can be seen on your “My proposals” page.
          Job proposals sent via job invitation can be found in the{" "}
          <b className="b-helpa">Accepted</b> Invites Section while those
          proposals that have been sent not via job invitation can found in the{" "}
          <b className="b-helpa">Pending</b> Proposals Section.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every time you send a job proposal to an Agent, either via job
          invitation or not, the agent will receive an email notification. But
          it does not give you, Helpa, the assurance that your job proposal will
          be accepted. If your job proposal will be accepted by an Agent, you
          will receive an email notification for a job interview invitation.
          When the job interview is successful, that is the time when the Agent
          decides to hire or offer you the position or not.{" "}
