          You can view all your contracts on your “My Contracts'' page. Here are
          the following guidelines for Helpa to end a contract:
        </p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            On your “My Contracts”, you can opt to end contracts whose status
            are:
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b className="b-helpa">Active</b> - these are contracts that are
              currently ongoing, which can be ended in two possible ways.{" "}
            </li>
            <p>
              One is to click the “View” on the action column of the job
              contract and you will be redirected to the “Contract Details” page
              where you can see three buttons at the upper right corner of the
              page. Click the “End” button, then an “End Contract” confirmation
              modal will pop up.
            </p>
            <p>
              Meanwhile, the other way to end the contract with an active status
              is to click the “End” on the action column of the job contract and
              automatically an “End Contract” confirmation modal will pop up.
            </p>
            <li>
              <b className="b-helpa">Pause</b> - these are contracts that are
              temporarily on-hold, which can be ended when you click the “View”
              on the action column of the job contract and you will be
              redirected to the “Contract Details” page where you can see three
              buttons at the upper right corner of the page. Click the “End”
              button, then an “End Contract” confirmation modal will pop up.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b className="b-helpa">Dispute</b> - these are contracts that need
              to be disputed, which can be ended when you click the “View” on
              the action column of the job contract and you will be redirected
              to the “Contract Details” page where you can see three buttons at
              the upper right corner of the page. Click the “End” button, then
              an “End Contract” confirmation modal will pop up.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            When the “End Contract” confirmation modal will pop up, you will
            then ask if you are sure to end the contract. If you are sure and
            have read the general tips to terminate a contract, click the “I
            understand” button. You will then be prompted to provide the reason
            for ending the job and give feedback. Please be reminded that by
            ending the contract:
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Your funds held in the escrow account will be dealt with in
              accordance with the terms and conditions.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can dispute the payment if you have a legitimate reason.
            </li>
            <p>
              If you have understood the notice of this confirmation modal and
              authorize KeyHelpa, click the “End contract” button and the
              contract will be terminated.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Once you end the contract, the Agent will receive an email
              notification and a notification card on his/her My Contracts'
              page.
            </p>
          </ul>
          <li>
            All terminated contracts can be seen on your “My Contracts” page End
            section.{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            You can still “Cancel” the contract you just have ended, if the
            Agent does not yet take action of the end contract notification he
            or she has received, where Agent can either Accept or Dispute the
            job contract. If the Agent confirms the termination of contract (by
            Accept button) , it means the contract and work has officially
            terminated and can no longer be resumed. Unless, if the Agent
            disputes the contract, that is another process.
          </li>
          <p>
            <b className="b-helpa">Note</b>: If you cancel a job 3 times within
            a month, your profile will be blocked automatically.
          </p>
        </ol>

          End of contract occurs when one of the parties of the contract ends
          the written agreement for various reasons. You, Helpa, also have the
          ability to end a contract on KeyHelpa any time. Though, it is
          important to confirm that all parties are aware and in agreement
          before a contract is terminated.
