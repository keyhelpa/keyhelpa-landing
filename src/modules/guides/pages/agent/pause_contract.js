          You can view all your contracts on your “My Contracts” page. Here are
          the following guidelines for Agent to pause a contract:
        </p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            On your “My Contracts”, you can opt to pause contracts whose status
            are:
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b className="b-agent">Active</b> - these are contracts that are
              currently ongoing, which can be paused when you click the “View”
              on the action column of the candidate’s contract and you will be
              redirected to the “Contract Details” page where you can see three
              buttons at the upper right corner of the page. Click the “Pause”
              button, then a “Pause Contract” confirmation modal will pop up.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b className="b-agent">Dispute</b> - these are contracts that are
              disputed, which can be paused when you click the “View” on the
              action column of the candidate’s contract and you will be
              redirected to the “Contract Details” page where you can see three
              buttons at the upper right corner of the page. Click the “Pause”
              button, then a “Pause Contract” confirmation modal will pop up.
            </li>
            <p>
              Please “Cancel Dispute” before you are going to pause this
              contract.
            </p>
            <li>
              <b className="b-agent">End</b> - these are contracts that are
              terminated. You can only pause this contract if the Helpa is not
              yet confirmed to accept the termination of this contract.{" "}
            </li>
            <p>
              This unconfirmed end contract status can be paused when you click
              the “View” on the action column of the candidate’s contract and
              you will be redirected to the “Contract Details” page where you
              can see three buttons at the upper right corner of the page. Click
              the “Pause” button, then a “Pause Contract” confirmation modal
              will pop up.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please “Cancel” termination of contract before you are going to
              pause this contract.
            </p>
          </ul>
          <li>
            When the “Pause Contract” confirmation modal will pop up, you will
            then ask if you are sure to pause the contract and you will be
            prompted to provide the reason for pausing the job and give
            feedback. Please be reminded that by pausing the contract:
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Your funds held in the escrow account will be dealt with in
              accordance with the terms and conditions.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can dispute the payment if you have a legitimate reason.
            </li>
            <p>
              If you have understood the notice of this confirmation modal and
              authorize KeyHelpa, click the “Pause contract” button and the
              contract will be paused or put to on-hold..{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Once you pause the contract,, the Helpa will receive an email
              notification and a notification card on his/her My Contracts'
              page.
            </p>
          </ul>
          <li>
            All paused contracts can be seen on your “My Contracts” page Pause
            section.{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            You can restart or put to active the status of the contract by
            clicking the “Resume” on the action column of the candidate’s
            contract and it will then be transferred back to the Active
            contracts section.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          If you have any concerns or inquiries, please don’t hesitate to{" "}

        >
          As an Agent, you can pause contracts any time you want to put work on
          hold. You may need to do this for many reasons. This pause prevents
          Helpa from rendering the time and effort on the job until you are
          ready to let them start again. In this cases, you must message your
          Helpa and explain why you have paused the contract and when you are
          planning to restart it.
