          To update your work preferences, read the following instructions
          below:
        </p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            On Helpa’s web application, click your profile icon or photo then a
            dropdown menu will appear.Choose “Settings” and you will be taken to
            a new sidebar menu. Click the “Work preferences" " on your sidebar
            menu and you will be redirected to the “Work preferences” page.
          </li>
          <li>
            On your “Work preferences” page, all of the information is
            automatically filled with data you have already entered during your
            profile setup. These are the datas you can update and edit on your
            work preferences info:
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b className="b-helpa">Region</b> - Select the regions that you
              wish to work in
            </li>
            <li>
              <b className="b-helpa">Job category</b> - Select all applicable
              categories that suit you.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b className="b-helpa">Hourly rate</b> - Set your hourly rate (In
              some jobs you may be required to use a car and travel between jobs
              - please factor this into your hourly rate. You can also change
              your hourly rate when making an offer on a job.)
            </li>
            <p>
              Please note that when setting your hourly rate, you will not
              receive the actual rate because KeyHelpa will take 11% from your
              hourly rate as service fee. Therefore, you will only receive an
              estimated 89% of the amount of your hourly rate (which basically
              has been subtracted from service fees).
            </p>
          </ul>
          <li>
            Once you have made changes or updates on your work preferences, just
            click the “Save” button to save your changes.
