          You can view all your contracts on your “My Contracts” page. Here are
          the following guidelines for Agent to end a contract:
        </p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            On your “My Contracts”, you can opt to end contracts whose status
            are:
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b className="b-agent">Active</b> - these are contracts that are
              currently ongoing, which can be ended in two possible ways.{" "}
            </li>
            <p>
              One is to click the “View” on the action column of the candidate’s
              contract and you will be redirected to the “Contract Details” page
              where you can see three buttons at the upper right corner of the
              page. Click the “End” button, then an “End Contract” confirmation
              modal will pop up.
            </p>
            <p>
              Meanwhile, the other way to end the contract with an active status
              is to click the “End” on the action column of the candidate’s
              contract and automatically an “End Contract” confirmation modal
              will pop up.
            </p>
            <li>
              <b className="b-agent">Pause</b> - these are contracts that are
              temporarily on-hold, which can be ended when you click the “View”
              on the action column of the candidate’s contract and you will be
              redirected to the “Contract Details” page where you can see three
              buttons at the upper right corner of the page. Click the “End”
              button, then an “End Contract” confirmation modal will pop up.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b className="b-agent">Dispute</b> - these are contracts that need
              to be disputed, which can be ended when you click the “View” on
              the action column of the candidate’s contract and you will be
              redirected to the “Contract Details” page where you can see three
              buttons at the upper right corner of the page. Click the “End”
              button, then an “End Contract” confirmation modal will pop up.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            When the “End Contract” confirmation modal will pop up, you will
            then ask if you are sure to end the contract. If you are sure and
            have read the general tips to terminate a contract, click the “I
            understand” button. You will then be prompted to provide the reason
            for ending the job and give feedback. Please be reminded that by
            ending the contract:
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Your funds held in the escrow account will be dealt with in
              accordance with the terms and conditions.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can dispute the payment if you have a legitimate reason.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you have understood the notice of this confirmation modal and
            authorize KeyHelpa, click the “End contract” button and the contract
            will be terminated.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you end the contract,, the Helpa will receive an email
            notification and a notification card on his/her My Contracts' page.
          </p>
          <li>
            All terminated contracts can be seen on your “My Contracts” page End
            section.{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            You can still “Cancel” the contract you just have ended, if the
            Helpa does not yet take action of the end contract notification he
            or she has received, where Helpa can either Accept or Dispute the
            job contract. If Helpa confirms the termination of contract (by
            Accept button) , it means the contract and work has officially
            terminated and can no longer be resumed. Unless, if Helpa disputes
            the contract, that is another process.
          </li>
          <p>
            <b className="b-agent">Note</b>: When you are cancelling the job
            less than 48 hours before it starts, the fine for this action is 1
            weekly payment.{" "}
          </p>
        </ol>
        <p>
          If you have any concerns or inquiries, please don’t hesitate to{" "}
          <a href="../contact_us">contact us</a>.{" "}

          End of contract occurs when one of the parties of the contract ends
          the written agreement for various reasons. You, Agent, who creates the
          contract through KeyHelpa and has it accepted by the Helpa, can end
          the contract of the job he/she has with the Helpa.
